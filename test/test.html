<html>
    <head>
        <script src="../simple-html-include.js"></script>
    </head>
        This text appears before the first include.
        <html-include src="include1.html"></html-include>
        This text appears between the first and second include.
        <ul>
            <html-include src="include2.html"></html-include>
        </ul>
        This text appears after the second include.<br>
        Now we'll include the first file again.
        <html-include src="include1.html"></html-include>

        And finally we'll try an include that doesn't exist, which should result in
        nothing rendering but a log message in the console.
        <html-include src="does-not-exist.html"></html-include>
    </body>
</html>
