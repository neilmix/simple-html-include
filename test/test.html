            let scriptExecs = 0;
            setTimeout(() => {
                const div = document.createElement("div");
                div.innerText = `scriptExecs: ${scriptExecs} (should be 3)`;
                document.body.appendChild(div);
            }, 1000);

    <body>
        This text appears before the first include.
        <html-include src="include1.html"></html-include>
        This text appears between the first and second include.
        <ul>
            <html-include src="include2.html"></html-include>
        </ul>
        This text appears after the second include.<br />
        Now we'll include the first file again.
        <html-include src="include1.html"></html-include>

        And finally we'll try an include that doesn't exist, which should result in nothing
        rendering but a log message in the console.
        <html-include src="does-not-exist.html"></html-include>
    </body>
</html>
